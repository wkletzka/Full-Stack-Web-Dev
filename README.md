# Full-Stack-Web-Dev

List of ideas (add to this as they pop up):

~ Portfolio Intelligence Platform
  - Have user breifly describe their investments/stategy/thesis/long-term goals
  - Provide AI driven actionable insights or ways to diversify
  - Scan online forums (Reddit, X, news, macro events) to make in the moment-suggestions
  - Risk analysis
  - Bearish/bullish predictions
  - Compare with well known investors' porfolios
  - Have a calculator that says '$X invested in TICKER in YYYY would be worth $Z today'
